## Overview

### The challenge

The core challenge in this game is for the player to guess the secret number chosen by the computer within the smallest number of attempts.

The number is guaranteed to be between 0 and 100. Narrowing down this set range takes logic and cunning guess choices.

Should a player start with 50? Or perhaps divide down based on hint feedback after each incorrect guess? The strategy is up to the player.

With every guess, the mystery draws closer to being unveiled.

The game tracks key statistics like:

    Highest Score: Least guesses to solve
    Average Score: Mean guesses taken
    Median and Mode: Central tendency clues

These metrics provide competitive benchmarking for players to continually improve against.

The challenge escalates as players vie for top spot on the leaderboard against friends and family. Besting their high scores infuses friendly competition.

Soon, precision guessing abilities emerge that players never knew!

With set bounds between 0-100, tailored statistics, and motivational peer leaderboards, this game provides guessing fun for all skill levels. But continually besting personal records presents overarching, addictive gameplay.
